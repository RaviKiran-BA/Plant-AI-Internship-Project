### Dataset  
- [Plant Leaf Disease Dataset- Downloaded from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asheniranga/leaf-disease-dataset-combination)

### Milestone 1 - Enhance the quality of the uploaded images to improve model accuracy.
- Importing the Dataset from either Google Drive or Kaggle
- Extracting the Dataset from either Google Drive or Kaggle
- Importing the Dependencies and Libraries
- Showing the Number of Images and Classes in the Dataset
- Image Quality Enhancement - Using OpenCV and Pillow for Preprocessing Techniques
- Noise Reduction - Applying Filters like Gaussian Blur Technique
- Color Normalization - Adjust color intensity to ensure consistent lighting and color representation.   
- Image Resizing - Resize images and editing height and width of images to a fixed dimension (e.g.,224x224 pixels) suitable for input into deep learning models.
- Data Augmentation - Create variations of the images(flipping, rotating) to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
- Normalization - Scale pixel values to a range of [0, 1] to enhance the training process of the neural network.
- Splitting the cleaned and enhanced dataset of images into Training and Testing Set
- Label Distribution and Visual Representation
